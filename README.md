Cohorts are assemble for a track. Can a cohort belong to more than one track = no.

Track <> Cohorts

Cohorts house a group of students.

Student can go through more than one cohort.

## Mantras

- every table must have a primary key.
- work o two or three tables at a time.
- one to many -> Foreign Key
- the FK goes on the `many` side.
- many to many -> third table.
- the (junction) many to many table can have other properties.

## Workflow

- identify entities (nouns) === resources -> tables.
- identify relationships -> Foreign Keys.
- identify properties (fields) -> columns.

## Relationships

- one to one. Not as common.
- one to many. This is it!
- many to many (fake!).
